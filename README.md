# mva-ts-project
Project for the ML Timeseries class of Master MVA

Study of the article *Offline detection of change-points in the mean for stationary graph signals* [1].

We implemented the method in the notebook `project_notebook.ipynb` using the [ruptures](https://github.com/deepcharles/ruptures) library. We experimented with different parameters to challenge the results presented in the article.

Our results are reported in the document `report.pdf`.
